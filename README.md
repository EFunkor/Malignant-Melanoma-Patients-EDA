# Malignant-Melanoma-Patients-Exploratory-Data-Analysis(EDA)

## Problem Statement ###

The data consists of measurements made on patients with malignant melanoma. Each patient
had their tumour removed by surgery at the Department of Plastic Surgery, University Hospital
of Odense, Denmark during the period 1962 to 1977. The surgery consisted of complete
removal of the tumour together with about 2.5cm of the surrounding skin.
Among the measurements taken were the thickness of the tumour and whether it was
ulcerated or not. These are thought to be important prognostic variables in that patients with a
thick and/or ulcerated tumour have an increased chance of death from melanoma. Patients
were followed until the end of 1977. 

## Objectives

1. Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Ensure the dataset is clean and free of inconsistencies.
Provide descriptive statistics for all variables to understand their distributions and identify any anomalies.

2. Survival Analysis:
Perform survival analysis to estimate survival functions and compare survival rates among different groups.
Assess the impact of tumour thickness and ulceration on survival time.

3. Statistical Modeling:
Develop Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the influence of prognostic variables on survival time.
Identify which factors (e.g., tumour thickness, ulceration, age, sex) are significant predictors of mortality.

4. Visualization:
Create visualizations (e.g., Kaplan-Meier curves, hazard plots) to illustrate survival probabilities and the effect of different variables on survival.

5. Visual tools and dashboards to aid clinicians in understanding the survival prospects of melanoma patients.

## Business Questions
1. Identify the data distribution of male and females?(ratio of males to females)
2. Variation on rate of death caused by melanoma with patients with ulcerated tumour.
3. How does age affect thickness of the tumour?
4. Distribution of tumor thickness among the patients?
5. Total number of ulcerated tumors patients had.
6. Find the average and median tumor thickness for patients with ulcerated and non-ulcerated tumors?
7. Identify relationship between tumor thickness and ulceration.
8. Survival rate among patients based on tumor thickness and ulceration status.
